#RPG Maker-Like Databases
Replicates RPG Maker's databases, each one having its own JSON file in the data folder.

##Resizable
This plugin is provided by Eranot at their [GitHub repo](https://github.com/Eranot/godot-resizable).
This plugin is used so that the various database screens will be small enough to fit small screens(like my own) but be expandable if you have a larger screen you want to take advantage of.
